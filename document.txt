Creator of the website
===========================  
-Created in 27, September 2018 by Michael Adel,
the Original Idea came from Udemy Course that i watched
Instructor [Malek Academy], i changed the design
and added my Coding style, added new feature.

============================
		NOTICE
============================
-website made for my self learning and portfolio, so that i would be 
able to find an intern job only, its not design to be 
very secure or for real bloging purpose. 

-the website is not fully responsive, there are some
designs need to be fix but its work well if you flip the 
screen like your watching a video.

-some bugs accrue when you copy an entire article and 
paste it in edit_article.php / new_article.php. mainly 
from white space new line [\n].

-there is an issue redirecting to 404.php, it stays at same page and dosent 
redirect it.
