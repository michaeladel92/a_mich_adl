It seems like everyone loves Clojure and Haskell and JavaScript and no one likes PHP. Maybe you just got lucky landing your first job?</p>\r\n<p>Maybe you start poking around the internet, what projects are actually built with PHP?</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Facebook</li>\r\n<li>WordPress</li>\r\n<li>Yahoo</li>\r\n<li>Wikipedia</li>\r\n<li>4chan</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s kind of ridiculous. A large portion of the worlds largest websites are written in PHP. It seems just inarguable that PHP is a worthwhile and practical language choice for making web applications, but I digress&hellip;</p>\r\n<h2>It&rsquo;s not 2004 anymore</h2>\r\n<p>A lot of these criticisms of PHP are predicated on things the language was missing when they last looked in the early 2000&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n<p>PHP has classes now and can do proper OOP. There are great frameworks like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://laravel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Laravel</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://symfony.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Symfony</a>.</p>\r\n<p>PHP has a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">package manager</a>&nbsp;which pulls from an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://packagist.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">enormous archive</a>&nbsp;of open source packages.</p>\r\n<p>PHP has great testing frameworks. Unit testing frameworks like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://phpunit.de/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">PHPUnit</a>&nbsp;and Behavioral testing like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://docs.behat.org/en/v2.5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Behat</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://codeception.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Codeception</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Some of the complaints in the aforementioned links are definitely reasonable. There are inconsistencies in the language, and there are certainly languages out there without as many problems but PHP holds up really well when you consider its age, flexibility and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/phps-creator-rasmus-lerdorf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">what it was designed for</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>The effect on developers</h2>\r\n<p>It is incredibly discouraging not being taken seriously as a developer despite working on serious development projects. It&rsquo;s really taken its toll on the community.</p>\r\n<p>It often feels like PHP developers end up in insular micro-communities. Feeling unwelcome in the larger software engineering community they frequently have their own meetups, their own user groups and their own conferences.</p>\r\n<h2>Anecdote</h2>\r\n<p>Sometimes I really do get tired of the judgment. Despite thinking that PHP is a perfectly fine language, I often think about abandoning PHP development entirely just so I don&rsquo;t have to deal with the judgment anymore.</p>\r\n<p>When I was younger I looked weird. I had dyed dreadlocks, facial piercings and patched clothing. I really liked looking that way, but it was exhausting.</p>\r\n<p>Taking college classes, applying for internships, starting my own company. It was a constant distraction. The best case scenario was being &lsquo;surprisingly professional&rsquo; for someone that &lsquo;looks like I do&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>10 years later, same problem &mdash; different distraction. You know a lot about compsci for a PHP developer. Bleh.</p>\r\n<h2>No end in sight</h2>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, I really don&rsquo;t see this problem going away. Often times, people are just complaining about PHP because it&rsquo;s a popular thing to do. But unfortunately I don&rsquo;t see it stopping any time soon.</p>\r\n<p>It really is unfortunate, and creates a chicken-egg situation. If PHP developers are made to feel terrible, they will leave and there will be less and less great developers working with PHP.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>', 'php programming', 'img/posts/post5baf6b6083b46.jpg', 1, 'published', '2018-09-29 12:09:04.541462'),
(5, 'Ancient Egyptian History', '<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html>\r\n<head>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n<p>For almost 30 centuries&mdash;from its unification around 3100 B.C. to its conquest by Alexander the Great in 332 B.C.&mdash;ancient Egypt was the preeminent civilization in the Mediterranean world. From the great pyramids of the Old Kingdom through the military conquests of the New Kingdom, Egypt&rsquo;s majesty has long entranced archaeologists and historians and created a vibrant field of study all its own: Egyptology. The main sources of information about ancient Egypt are the many monuments, objects and artifacts that have been recovered from archaeological sites, covered with hieroglyphs that have only recently been deciphered. The picture that emerges is of a culture with few equals in the beauty of its art, the accomplishment of its architecture or the richness of its religious traditions.</p>\r\n<h2>Predynastic Period (c. 5000-3100 B.C.)</h2>\r\n<p>Few written records or artifacts have been found from the Predynastic Period, which encompassed at least 2,000 years of gradual development of the Egyptian civilization.</p>\r\n<aside>\r\n<p>Did you know? During the rule of Akhenaton, his wife Nefertiti played an important political and religious role in the monotheistic cult of the sun god Aton. Images and sculptures of Nefertiti depict her famous beauty and role as a living goddess of fertility</p>\r\n</aside>\r\n<p>Neolithic (late&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/stone-age\">Stone Age</a>) communities in northeastern Africa exchanged hunting for agriculture and made early advances that paved the way for the later development of Egyptian arts and crafts, technology, politics and religion (including a great reverence for the dead and possibly a belief in life after death).</p>\r\n<p>Around 3400 B.C., two separate kingdoms were established: the Red Land to the north, based in the Nile River Delta and extending along the Nile perhaps to Atfih; and the White Land in the south, stretching from Atfih to Gebel es-Silsila. A southern king, Scorpion, made the first attempts to conquer the northern kingdom around 3200 B.C. A century later, King Menes would subdue the north and unify the country, becoming the first king of the first dynasty.</p>\r\n<h2>Archaic (Early Dynastic) Period (c. 3100-2686 B.C.)</h2>\r\n<p>King Menes founded the capital of ancient Egypt at White Walls (later known as Memphis), in the north, near the apex of the Nile River delta. The capital would grow into a great metropolis that dominated Egyptian society during the Old Kingdom period. The Archaic Period saw the development of the foundations of Egyptian society, including the all-important ideology of kingship. To the ancient Egyptians, the king was a godlike being, closely identified with the all-powerful god Horus. The earliest known hieroglyphic writing also dates to this period.</p>\r\n<p>In the Archaic Period, as in all other periods, most ancient Egyptians were farmers living in small villages, and agriculture (largely wheat and barley) formed the economic base of the Egyptian state. The annual flooding of the great Nile River provided the necessary irrigation and fertilization each year; farmers sowed the wheat after the flooding receded and harvested it before the season of high temperatures and drought returned.</p>\r\n<p>The Old Kingdom began with the third dynasty of pharaohs. Around 2630 B.C., the third dynasty&rsquo;s King Djoser asked Imhotep, an architect, priest and healer, to design a funerary monument for him; the result was the world&rsquo;s first major stone building, the Step-Pyramid at Saqqara, near Memphis. Pyramid-building reached its zenith with the construction of the Great Pyramid at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Built for Khufu (or Cheops, in Greek), who ruled from 2589 to 2566 B.C., the pyramid was later named by classical historians as one of the ancient world&rsquo;s Seven Wonders. Two other pyramids were built at Giza for Khufu&rsquo;s successors Khafra (2558-2532 B.C) and Menkaura (2532-2503 B.C.).</p>\r\n<p>During the third and fourth dynasties, Egypt enjoyed a golden age of peace and prosperity. The pharaohs held absolute power and provided a stable central government; the kingdom faced no serious threats from abroad; and successful military campaigns in foreign countries like Nubia and Libya added to its considerable economic prosperity. Over the course of the fifth and sixth dynasties, the king&rsquo;s wealth was steadily depleted, partially due to the huge expense of pyramid-building, and his absolute power faltered in the face of the growing influence of the nobility and the priesthood that grew up around the sun god Ra (Re). After the death of the sixth dynasty&rsquo;s King Pepy II, who ruled for some 94 years, the Old Kingdom period ended in chaos.</p>\r\n<h2>First Intermediate Period (c. 2181-2055 B.C.)</h2>\r\n<p>On the heels of the Old Kingdom&rsquo;s collapse, the seventh and eighth dynasties consisted of a rapid succession of Memphis-based rulers until about 2160 B.C., when the central authority completely dissolved, leading to civil war between provincial governors. This chaotic situation was intensified by Bedouin invasions and accompanied by famine and disease.</p>\r\n<p>From this era of conflict emerged two different kingdoms: A line of 17 rulers (dynasties nine and 10) based in Heracleopolis ruled Middle Egypt between Memphis and Thebes, while another family of rulers arose in Thebes to challenge Heracleopolitan power. Around 2055 B.C., the Theban prince Mentuhotep managed to topple Heracleopolis and reunited Egypt, beginning the 11th dynasty and ending the First Intermediate Period.</p>\r\n<h2>Middle Kingdom: 12th Dynasty (c. 2055-1786 B.C.)</h2>\r\n<p>After the last ruler of the 11th dynasty, Mentuhotep IV, was assassinated, the throne passed to his vizier, or chief minister, who became King Amenemhet I, founder of dynasty 12. A new capital was established at It-towy, south of Memphis, while Thebes remained a great religious center. During the Middle Kingdom, Egypt once again flourished, as it had during the Old Kingdom. The 12th dynasty kings ensured the smooth succession of their line by making each successor co-regent, a custom that began with Amenemhet I.</p>\r\n<p>Middle-Kingdom Egypt pursued an aggressive foreign policy, colonizing Nubia (with its rich supply of gold, ebony, ivory and other resources) and repelling the Bedouins who had infiltrated Egypt during the First Intermediate Period. The kingdom also built diplomatic and trade relations with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/the-history-of-syria\">Syria</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/palestine\">Palestine</a>&nbsp;and other countries; undertook building projects including military fortresses and mining quarries; and returned to pyramid-building in the tradition of the Old Kingdom. The Middle Kingdom reached its peak under Amenemhet III (1842-1797 B.C.); its decline began under Amenenhet IV (1798-1790 B.C.) and continued under his sister and regent, Queen Sobekneferu (1789-1786 B.C.), who was the first confirmed female ruler of Egypt and the last ruler of the 12th dynasty.</p>\r\n<aside>\r\n<div data-class-rules=\"[{\" data-ad-group=\"in_content-1\" data-max-ad-reloads=\"5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</aside>\r\n<h2>Second Intermediate Period (c. 1786-1567 B.C.)</h2>\r\n<p>The 13th dynasty marked the beginning of another unsettled period in Egyptian history, during which a rapid succession of kings failed to consolidate power. As a consequence, during the Second Intermediate Period Egypt was divided into several spheres of influence. The official royal court and seat of government was relocated to Thebes, while a rival dynasty (the 14th), centered on the city of Xois in the Nile delta, seems to have existed at the same time as the 13th.</p>\r\n<p>Around 1650 B.C., a line of foreign rulers known as the Hyksos took advantage of Egypt&rsquo;s instability to take control. The Hyksos rulers of the 15th dynasty adopted and continued many of the existing Egyptian traditions in government as well as culture. They ruled concurrently with the line of native Theban rulers of the 17th dynasty, who retained control over most of southern Egypt despite having to pay taxes to the Hyksos. (The 16th dynasty is variously believed to be Theban or Hyksos rulers.) Conflict eventually flared between the two groups, and the Thebans launched a war against the Hyksos around 1570 B.C., driving them out of Egypt.</p>\r\n<h2>New Kingdom (c. 1567-1085 B.C.)</h2>\r\n<p>Under Ahmose I, the first king of the 18th dynasty, Egypt was once again reunited. During the 18th dynasty, Egypt restored its control over Nubia and began military campaigns in Palestine, clashing with other powers in the area such as the Mitannians and the Hittites. The country went on to establish the world&rsquo;s first great empire, stretching from Nubia to the Euphrates River in Asia. In addition to powerful kings such as Amenhotep I (1546-1526 B.C.), Thutmose I (1525-1512 B.C.) and Amenhotep III (1417-1379 B.C.), the New Kingdom was notable for the role of royal women such as Queen&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/hatshepsut\">Hatshepsut</a>&nbsp;(1503-1482 B.C.), who began ruling as a regent for her young stepson (he later became Thutmose III, Egypt&rsquo;s greatest military hero), but rose to wield all the powers of a pharaoh.</p>\r\n<p>The controversial Amenhotep IV (c. 1379-1362), of the late 18th dynasty, undertook a religious revolution, disbanding the priesthoods dedicated to Amon-Re (a combination of the local Theban god Amon and the sun god Re) and forcing the exclusive worship of another sun-god, Aton. Renaming himself Akhenaton (&ldquo;servant of the Aton&rdquo;), he built a new capital in Middle Egypt called Akhetaton, known later as Amarna. Upon Akhenaton&rsquo;s death, the capital returned to Thebes and Egyptians returned to worshiping a multitude of gods. The 19th and 20th dynasties, known as the Ramesside period (for the line of kings named Ramses) saw the restoration of the weakened Egyptian empire and an impressive amount of building, including great temples and cities. According to biblical chronology, the Exodus of Moses and the Israelites from Egypt possibly occurred during the reign of Ramses II (1304-1237 B.C.).</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>All of the New Kingdom rulers (with the exception of Akhenaton) were laid to rest in deep, rock-cut tombs (not pyramids) in the Valley of the Kings, a burial site on the west bank of the Nile opposite Thebes. Most of them were raided and destroyed, with the exception of the tomb and treasure of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/tutankhamen\">Tutankhamen</a>(c.1361-1352 B.C.), discovered largely intact in A.D. 1922. The splendid mortuary temple of the last great king of the 20th dynasty, Ramses III (c. 1187-1156 B.C.), was also relatively well preserved, and indicated the prosperity Egypt still enjoyed during his reign. The kings who followed Ramses III were less successful: Egypt lost its provinces in Palestine and Syria for good and suffered from foreign invasions (notably by the Libyans), while its wealth was being steadily but inevitably depleted.</p>\r\n<aside>\r\n<div data-class-rules=\"[{\" data-ad-group=\"in_content-2\" data-max-ad-reloads=\"5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</aside>\r\n<h2>Third Intermediate Period (c. 1085-664 B.C.)</h2>\r\n<p>The next 400 years&ndash;known as the Third Intermediate Period&ndash;saw important changes in Egyptian politics, society and culture. Centralized government under the 21st dynasty pharaohs gave way to the resurgence of local officials, while foreigners from Libya and Nubia grabbed power for themselves and left a lasting imprint on Egypt&rsquo;s population. The 22nd dynasty began around 945 B.C. with King Sheshonq, a descendant of Libyans who had invaded Egypt during the late 20th dynasty and settled there. Many local rulers were virtually autonomous during this period and dynasties 23-24 are poorly documented.</p>\r\n<p>In the eighth century B.C., Nubian pharaohs beginning with Shabako, ruler of the Nubian kingdom of Kush, established their own dynasty&ndash;the 25th&ndash;at Thebes. Under Kushite rule, Egypt clashed with the growing Assyrian empire. In 671 B.C., the Assyrian ruler Esarhaddon drove the Kushite king Taharka out of Memphis and destroyed the city; he then appointed his own rulers out of local governors and officials loyal to the Assyrians. One of them, Necho of Sais, ruled briefly as the first king of the 26th dynasty before being killed by the Kushite leader Tanuatamun, in a final, unsuccessful grab for power.</p>\r\n<h2>From the Late Period to Alexander&rsquo;s Conquest (c.664-332 B.C.)</h2>\r\n<p>Beginning with Necho&rsquo;s son, Psammetichus, the Saite dynasty ruled a reunified Egypt for less than two centuries. In 525 B.C., Cambyses, king of Persia, defeated Psammetichus III, the last Saite king, at the Battle of Pelusium, and Egypt became part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/persian-empire\">Persian Empire</a>. Persian rulers such as Darius (522-485 B.C.) ruled the country largely under the same terms as native Egyptian kings: Darius supported Egypt&rsquo;s religious cults and undertook the building and restoration of its temples. The tyrannical rule of Xerxes (486-465 B.C.) sparked increased uprisings under him and his successors. One of these rebellions triumphed in 404 B.C., beginning one last period of Egyptian independence under native rulers (dynasties 28-30).</p>\r\n<p>In the mid-fourth century B.C., the Persians again attacked Egypt, reviving their empire under Ataxerxes III in 343 B.C. Barely a decade later, in 332 B.C.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/alexander-the-great\">Alexander the Great</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/macedonia\">Macedonia</a>&nbsp;defeated the armies of the Persian Empire and conquered Egypt. After Alexander&rsquo;s death, Egypt was ruled by a line of Macedonian kings, beginning with Alexander&rsquo;s general Ptolemy and continuing with his descendants. The last ruler of Ptolemaic Egypt&ndash;the legendary&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/cleopatra\">Cleopatra</a>&nbsp;VII&ndash;surrendered Egypt to the armies of Octavian (later&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/emperor-augustus\">Augustus</a>) in 31 B.C. Six centuries of Roman rule followed, during which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/history-of-christianity\">Christianity</a>&nbsp;became the official religion of Rome and its provinces (including Egypt). The conquest of Egypt by the Arabs in the seventh century A.D. and the introduction of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/islam\">Islam</a>would do away with the last outward aspects of ancient Egyptian culture and propel the country towards its modern incarnation.</p>\r\n<h2>PHOTO GALLERIES</h2>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2>Egyptian Relief Sculpture and Paintings</h2>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<figure></figure>\r\n<figure><img style=\"line-height: 1.4em; height: 400px; width: auto;\" src=\"https://www.history.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_406%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTU3ODc5MDg2NDMwOTU1MjMx/front-view-of-the.jpg\" alt=\"Front View Of The\" /></figure>\r\n<figure></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2>Egyptian Pyramids</h2>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<figure><img style=\"line-height: 1.4em; height: auto; max-width: 100%;\" src=\"https://www.history.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_406%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTU3ODc5MDg2NzA0MzA1ODg3/pyramids-of-giza-4.jpg\" alt=\"Pyramids Of Giza 4\" /></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>', 'History', 'img/posts/post5baf6dd996eec.jpg', 1, 'published', '2018-09-29 12:18:37.683792');

For example, the cyclic pattern of the sun and seasonal pattern of Nile floods (that enriched the soil) played their crucial roles in establishing the water and the sun as symbols of life. The very geographical core of the ancient Egyptian civilization &ndash; the fertile Nile Delta, was surrounded by arid lands and deserts (populated by fringe groups of raiders and nomads). Inspired by these real-time scenarios, the Egyptians regarded their land as the haven for tranquil stability, which in turn was ringed by swathes of lawless realms &ndash; thus essentially creating the trichotomy of order, chaos, and renewal; themes that are integral to the ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, historical events also played their part in &lsquo;shaping&rsquo; the Egyptian gods and goddesses by the end of the Predynastic Period, circa 3100 BC. This was the epoch when Egyptian pharaohs united both the Upper and Lower realms, which in turn made such kings the focus of adulation in the religious context. Furthermore,&nbsp;the progression of history is not linear, and as such many of the Egyptian deities evolved (and merged) into variant entities and aspects, mirroring the preference of the ruling classes of the said period.&nbsp;Taking these multifarious factors into consideration, let us take a gander at the fifteen ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses you should know about.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>1) Nun &ndash; The Primeval God</h4>\r\n<div><img style=\"line-height: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_1-min.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_1-min.jpg 770w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_1-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_1-min-768x512.jpg 768w\" alt=\"egyptian gods_Ancient Egyptian gods_gods_Egyptian goddess-15\" width=\"770\" height=\"513\" data-lazy-type=\"image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_1-min.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_1-min.jpg 770w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_1-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_1-min-768x512.jpg 768w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" />\r\n<p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fallenshadow.darkbb.com/t1006-some-egyptian-gods\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FallenShadow Forum</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Every mythology tends to start with the primordial origins, and in Egyptian mythology, that scope is covered by the ancient Egyptian gods&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.ancientegyptonline.co.uk/nun.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nun</a></em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Naunet</em>&nbsp;(the feminine form). In essence, the ancient Egyptians perceived&nbsp;<em>Nun</em>&nbsp;as the watery abyss that basically held the universe by which the sphere of life was borne. This watery mass was endowed with enigmatic characteristics by the Egyptians &ndash; with its depth epitomizing both nothingness and infinity, while also serving as the source of all aspects of divine and earthly existence.</p>\r\n<p>So in many ways,&nbsp;<em>Nun</em>, like&nbsp;<em>Tiamat</em>&nbsp;&ndash; the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/2017/05/09/10-ancient-mesopotamian-gods-goddesses-facts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mesopotamian primordial goddess</a>&nbsp;of the oceans, was associated, albeit neutrally, with the forces of chaos. And in terms of his physical attribute,&nbsp;<em>Nun</em>&nbsp;was often represented as a bearded man with blue or green skin (thus suggesting his connection with the watery mass of Nile and fertility). On occasions, he was also depicted as a frog or a frog-headed man (as part of the&nbsp;<em>Ogdoad</em>&nbsp;system practiced at Khmunu or Hermopolis) or even a hermaphrodite with discernable breasts.</p>\r\n<h4>2) Amun, Ra, and Amun-Ra &ndash; The Ancient Egyptian gods of Sun and Wind</h4>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div><img style=\"line-height: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_16-min.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_16-min.jpg 500w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_16-min-200x300.jpg 200w\" alt=\"egyptian gods_Ancient Egyptian gods_gods_Egyptian goddess-14\" width=\"500\" height=\"749\" data-lazy-type=\"image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_16-min.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_16-min.jpg 500w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_16-min-200x300.jpg 200w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" />\r\n<p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO9080-Ra.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Paizo</a>.

Sometimes portrayed as the king of gods, Amun was also the patron deity of Thebes, the royal capital during the impressive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/2017/06/16/10-facts-ancient-egyptian-armies-new-kingdom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New Kingdom era of Egypt</a>, circa 16th century BC to 11th century BC. In fact, in the earlier centuries,&nbsp;<em>Amun</em>&nbsp;was a minor god, and as such played second fiddle to &lsquo;war gods&rsquo; like&nbsp;<em>Montu</em>. However, the New Kingdom period brought forth the ascendancy of the diety, who was venerated as the &lsquo;Self-Created One&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p><em>Ra</em>, on the other hand, was considered as one of the powerful ancient Egyptian gods who was associated with the Pharoah &ndash; so much so, that by Fifth Dynasty, almost every ruler was symbolically hailed as the son of&nbsp;<em>Ra</em>. He was also associated with the earlier sun god&nbsp;<em>Atum</em>&nbsp;of Heliopolis. And over time, especially during the New Kingdom, the thriving Amun cult merged the two entities&nbsp;<em>Amun</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Ra</em>&nbsp;into a composite god known as&nbsp;<em>Amun-Ra</em>, who was hailed as the &ldquo;Lord of truth, father of the gods, maker of men, creator of all animals, Lord of things that are, creator of the staff of life.&rdquo; According to many scholars,&nbsp;<em>Amun-Ra</em>&nbsp;sort of symbolized the combination of the invisible force (of wind) with the visible majesty (of the life-giving sun), thus establishing an all-encompassing deity who covered most aspects of creation.</p>\r\n<h4>3) Hathor &ndash; The Cow Goddess</h4>\r\n<div><img style=\"line-height: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_3-min.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_3-min.jpg 770w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_3-min-300x224.jpg 300w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_3-min-768x575.jpg 768w\" alt=\"egyptian gods_Ancient Egyptian gods_gods_Egyptian goddess-13\" width=\"770\" height=\"576\" data-lazy-type=\"image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_3-min.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_3-min.jpg 770w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_3-min-300x224.jpg 300w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_3-min-768x575.jpg 768w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" />\r\n<p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.everythingselectric.com/suckling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EverthingsElectric</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The ancient Egyptian goddess of joy, feminine love, and motherhood;&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.ancient.eu/Hathor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hathor</a></em>&nbsp;(meaning &ndash; &lsquo;Domain of Horus&rsquo;) was closely associated (or was the successor) to&nbsp;<em>Mehet-Weret</em>, the primeval divine cow entity/goddess who was perceived as being responsible for bringing the floods to the Nile, thus in the process fertilizing the land. Continuing with this possibly pre-dynastic concept, Hathor was also regarded as the mother of the sun god&nbsp;<em>Ra</em>.</p>\r\n<p>As for her name referring to the &lsquo;Domain of Horus&rsquo;,&nbsp;<em>Hathor</em>&nbsp;possibly comes from the Egyptian myth of&nbsp;<em>Horus</em>&nbsp;&ndash; one of the prominent Egyptian gods (discussed later in the article), and how he entered her mouth to rest and then again come back at dawn. Considering these aspects, suffice it to say,&nbsp;<em>Hathor</em>was regarded as a protective and benevolent deity who often personified kindness. She was also closely associated with matters of womanly love and health, so much so that many women beheld her as the counterpart to Osiris in the afterlife.</p>\r\n<p>And as for her physical attributes,&nbsp;<em>Hathor</em>&nbsp;was often depicted as a woman with the head of a cow or having an entire cow form. Later on, the bovine features were relegated in favor of a woman&rsquo;s face (but still with cow&rsquo;s ears or horns).

A goddess of the home, love, fertility, joy, dance, women and secrets,&nbsp;<em>Bastet</em>&nbsp;with her cat-like head and woman&rsquo;s body was considered as a benevolent deity.</p>\r\n<p>Given such propensity for feline symbolization, cats were uniquely sacred in Egypt &ndash; so much so that the punishment for killing a cat was death by stabbing. According to Herodotus, Egyptians was so fond of their cats that they preferred to save their cats instead of themselves when trapped inside a burning building. Some cats were also known to be mummified in a ceremonious manner with jewelry &ndash; as was the case with many noble people.</p>\r\n<p>Interestingly enough, according to a legend, the Persians&nbsp;took advantage of this seemingly unhealthy feline fascination of the Egyptians by positioning many such animals and&nbsp;<em>Bastet</em>&nbsp;images (painted on their shields) in the front-lines at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/2015/09/05/the-battle-of-pelusium-cats-and-psychological-edge-lead-persians-to-victory/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Battle of Pelusium</a>&nbsp;in circa 525 BC. The adorable critters ranging from cats, dogs to even sheep, dissuaded the animal-loving Egyptians from firing their arrows &ndash; thus allowing the Persians to take the initiative and win the battle.</p>\r\n<p>And with all the&nbsp;talk about battles,&nbsp;it should be noted that Egyptians also venerated&nbsp;<em>Bastet</em>&nbsp;in the form of her &lsquo;alter-ego&rsquo;&nbsp;<em>Sekhmet</em>&nbsp;&ndash; the warrior lioness. She was often given the epithet of &lsquo;Sekhmet&nbsp;the Powerful&rsquo; and represented as the fiercest hunter in all of Egypt whose very breath formed the desert (while her pedigree was also associated with the Solar deity). Given such regal characteristics, it doesn&rsquo;t really come as a surprise that many Pharaohs regarded her as their protector in battles.</p>\r\n<h4>5) Maat &ndash; The Goddess of Order</h4>\r\n<div><img style=\"line-height: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_5-min.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_5-min.jpg 350w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_5-min-145x300.jpg 145w\" alt=\"egyptian gods_Ancient Egyptian gods_gods_Egyptian goddess-11\" width=\"350\" height=\"725\" data-lazy-type=\"image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_5-min.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_5-min.jpg 350w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_5-min-145x300.jpg 145w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" />\r\n<p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Maat.svg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wikimedia Commons</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The ancient Egyptian goddess of truth, justice, and, the cosmic order (alluding to the Egyptian concept of&nbsp;<em>ma&rsquo;at</em>),&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Maat-Egyptian-goddess\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Maat</a></em>&nbsp;(or ma-yet) was responsible for regulating both the stars and the seasons. Venerated as an important deity during the Old Kingdom period (circa 27th century &ndash; 22nd century BC), she was considered as the daughter of&nbsp;<em>Atum</em>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<em>Ra</em>), and as such implied the superiority of order, justice, and even harmony.</p>\r\n<p>Pertaining to these aspects, the&nbsp;<em>ma&rsquo;at</em>&nbsp;was envisaged as a guideline for human behavior that would conform to the will of the gods, thus in the process establishing a universal order. This cosmic balance was also reflected in the studies of the ancient Egyptian astronomers who charted the Earth&rsquo;s orbit with the celestial paths of the stars and other planets. Simply put, this ambit of balance was perceived as a principle that was to be adopted by Egyptians in their daily lives, which in turn established the virtues of truth, family life, and the belief system centered around the various deities.</p>\r\n<p>And when it comes to her physical appearance,&nbsp;<em>Maat</em>&nbsp;was often depicted as a winged woman with an ostrich feather on her head. The latter apparel had symbolic significance since the feather of&nbsp;<em>Maat</em>&nbsp;was the instrumental object in the Weighing of the Heart ceremony in the afterlife. The Egyptians believed that after their death, the heart of their soul was to be weighed against the feather in a &lsquo;scale of justice&rsquo;, which would allow the sections of their spirits (or life force) to be ultimately released to&nbsp;<em>Akh</em>(the composite soul).</p>\r\n<h4>6) Ptah &ndash; The Creator God</h4>\r\n<div><img style=\"line-height: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_6-min.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_6-min.jpg 500w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_6-min-225x300.jpg 225w\" alt=\"egyptian gods_Ancient Egyptian gods_gods_Egyptian goddess-10\" width=\"500\" height=\"666\" data-lazy-type=\"image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_6-min.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_6-min.jpg 500w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_6-min-225x300.jpg 225w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" />\r\n<p>Source:<a href=\"http://i-cias.com/e.o/ptah.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&nbsp;I-Cias</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>One of the Egyptian gods who formed the triad&nbsp;of Memphis (along with his spouse&nbsp;<em>Sekhmet</em>&nbsp;and daughter&nbsp;<em>Nefertum</em>),&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.crystalinks.com/ptah.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Ptah</em></a>&nbsp;was the personification of creation.

However, she further rose in significance during the Old Kingdom period, as one of the prominent characters of the Osiris myth, in which she not only resurrects her murdered husband, the divine king&nbsp;<em>Osiris</em>&nbsp;but also successfully gives birth and protects his heir,&nbsp;<em>Horus</em>.</p>\r\n<p>This narrative was symbolically mirrored in the affairs of the ancient Egyptian state, with the very name&nbsp;<em>Isis</em>&nbsp;being derived from Egyptian&nbsp;<em>Eset</em>, (&lsquo;the seat&rsquo;), which refers to the throne. In essence, the Egyptian goddess was perceived as the divine mother of the kings, while&nbsp;<em>Horus</em>&nbsp;(discussed later in the article) was associated with the Pharaohs themselves. This analogy of the throne was also prevalent in the very depiction of&nbsp;<em>Isis</em>, with her original headdress carrying an empty throne that signified the seat of her slain husband.</p>\r\n<p>Over time,&nbsp;<em>Isis</em>&nbsp;was given various epithets like&nbsp;<em>Weret-Kekau</em>&nbsp;(&lsquo;the Great Magic&rsquo;) and even&nbsp;<em>Mut-Netjer&nbsp;</em>(&lsquo;the Mother of the Gods&rsquo;). Judging by these titles, it doesn&rsquo;t come as a surprise that&nbsp;<em>Isis</em>&nbsp;overtook all the previous Egyptian goddesses in popularity, so much so that later on some of them were relegated to mere aspects of&nbsp;<em>Isis</em>.

A part of the later-formed&nbsp;Abydos Triad (comprising him, his wife, and his son),&nbsp;<em>Osiris</em>&nbsp;was possibly the only Egyptian deity who was directly referred to simply as a &lsquo;god&rsquo;, thus alluding to his immense prominence among the ancient Egyptian worshippers (many of whom considered&nbsp;<em>Osiris</em>&nbsp;as the first king of Egypt).</p>\r\n<p>In addition to his role as the lord of the underworld &ndash; a title that was passed to him after his murder by his brother&nbsp;<em>Set</em>,&nbsp;<em>Osiris</em>&nbsp;was also regarded as the god of transition (since a death in itself was not seen as an absolute condition) and even regeneration. Furthermore,&nbsp;<em>Osiris</em>&nbsp;also fulfilled his duty as the Judge of the Dead, as he was the central figure who decided the deceased&rsquo;s fate after the aforementioned&nbsp;Weighing of the Heart ceremony (see the&nbsp;<em>Maat</em>&nbsp;entry). Interestingly enough, in such cases, we can comprehend the pragmatic nature of ancient Egyptian gods and religion &ndash; since as opposed to advocating puritan morality, the deceased was only expected to live a &lsquo;balanced&rsquo; former life.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, coming to the physical attributes of&nbsp;<em>Osiris</em>, the god was often depicted as a mummified bearded king with a green or black skin &ndash; to represent both death and resurrection. And as a living god,&nbsp;<em>Osiris</em>was represented rather ostentatiously as a handsome man in the royal attire wearing the crown of Upper Egypt (a headdress known as the&nbsp;<em>atef</em>)<em>,&nbsp;</em>while&nbsp;carrying the crook and flail, both symbols of kingship.</p>\r\n<h4>9) Horus &ndash; The Falcon God</h4>\r\n<div><img style=\"line-height: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_9-min.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_9-min.jpg 550w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_9-min-240x300.jpg 240w\" alt=\"egyptian gods_Ancient Egyptian gods_gods_Egyptian goddess-7\" width=\"550\" height=\"687\" data-lazy-type=\"image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_9-min.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_9-min.jpg 550w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_9-min-240x300.jpg 240w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" />\r\n<p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/536772849328875480/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pinterest</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The most well-known of all &lsquo;avian&rsquo; Egyptian gods,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ancientegypt.co.uk/gods/explore/horus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Horus</em></a>&nbsp;was also possibly one of the first known national Egyptian gods, who was worshipped in various forms and aspects from the&nbsp;Predynastic period to the Roman Egypt epoch.

His legacy is also fueled by his epic mythical battle against the adversary&nbsp;<em>Set</em>, from which&nbsp;<em>Horus</em>&nbsp;emerged victorious, thereby uniting the two lands of Egypt, albeit after losing one of his eyes. In essence, the avenging Egyptian deity was also perceived as a god of war whose name was frequently invoked before actual battles by the rulers and commanders.</p>\r\n<p>As for his physical attributes,&nbsp;<em>Horus</em>, especially when&nbsp;combined with the sun god&nbsp;<em>Ra</em>&nbsp;to form&nbsp;<em>Ra-Harahkhte</em>, was usually depicted as a falcon-headed man&nbsp;wearing the&nbsp;<em>pschent</em>, the symbol of kingship over unified Egypt. On the other hand, his restored eye, personified as the Eye of Horus, was the ancient Egyptian symbol for protection and sacrifice. Quite intriguingly, the Ptolemaic dynasty favored another form of&nbsp;<em>Horus</em>&nbsp;known as&nbsp;<em>Harpocrates</em>&nbsp;(or &lsquo;Horus the Child&rsquo;), who was depicted as a winged-child with a finger on his lips &ndash; suggesting the virtue of silence and keeping secrets.</p>\r\n<h4>10) Set &ndash; The Antagonist God</h4>\r\n<div><img style=\"line-height: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_18-min.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_18-min.jpeg 500w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_18-min-191x300.jpeg 191w\" alt=\"egyptian gods_Ancient Egyptian gods_gods_Egyptian goddess-6\" width=\"500\" height=\"785\" data-lazy-type=\"image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_18-min.jpeg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_18-min.jpeg 500w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_18-min-191x300.jpeg 191w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" />\r\n<p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?720033-The-God-and-Goddesses-of-Ancient-Osirion&amp;s=1e130527efae221a31c5e1cfdf178ea9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RPG Forum</a>.

However, if we consider the historical evidence,&nbsp;<em>Set</em>&nbsp;was the perceived as a divine entity since the Predynastic period (before 3rd millennium BC), with his center of worship possibly originating from the town of Nubt, which is one of the oldest settlements in Upper Egypt. And interestingly enough, Nubt served as the gateway to the&nbsp;eastern desert and its gold deposits, which possibly explains the association of&nbsp;<em>Set</em>&nbsp;with the deserts of Egypt.</p>\r\n<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Set</em>&nbsp;was originally regarded as a more-or-less benevolent and esteemed entity who sometimes served as an ally of&nbsp;<em>Ra</em>, and was tasked with the protection of oases in the deserts. But over time, he was also associated with peculiar and frightening phenomena like eclipses, storms, and thunders &ndash; thus suggesting a dark side to his personification. Once again, reverting to history, some part of this scope possibly had to do with the foreign Hyksos, who adopted&nbsp;<em>Set</em>&nbsp;as one of their gods &ndash; which could have fueled a reactionary measure from the future native Egyptians who saw&nbsp;<em>Set</em>&nbsp;as an agent of evil. Other historians have hypothesized that the battle between&nbsp;<em>Set</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Horus</em>, as opposed to a confrontation between good and evil, was rather a symbolic representation of the struggle to unite Egypt under one ruler.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, the &lsquo;strange&rsquo; nature of&nbsp;<em>Set</em>&nbsp;as one of the dualistic ancient Egyptian gods is also manifested by his depictions. They often showcase a creature which is simply known as the Set animal, which could be a&nbsp;composite of an&nbsp;aardvark, a&nbsp;donkey, and a&nbsp;jackal (or a&nbsp;fennec fox). A few scholars have argued that the Set animal possibly represents a giraffe, though ancient Egyptians seem to have differentiated between giraffes and the enigmatic hybrid creature. And the Late Egyptian period (post 664 BC) artists tended to depict&nbsp;<em>Set</em>&nbsp;exclusively with a donkey head.</p>\r\n<h4>11) Anubis &ndash; The Jackal God</h4>\r\n<div><img style=\"line-height: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_11-min.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_11-min.jpg 550w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_11-min-237x300.jpg 237w\" alt=\"egyptian gods_Ancient Egyptian gods_gods_Egyptian goddess-5\" width=\"550\" height=\"696\" data-lazy-type=\"image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_11-min.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_11-min.jpg 550w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_11-min-237x300.jpg 237w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" />\r\n<p>Illustrated by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.artstation.com/chrisbjors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chris Bjors</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Possibly of the most visually recognizable of the ancient Egyptian gods,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends/anubis-jackal-god-and-guide-ancient-egyptian-afterlife-006155\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anubis</a></em>&nbsp;(or rather&nbsp;<em>Anpu</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Inpu</em>in Egyptian language) was represented as a jackal-headed entity associated with the rites of embalming the deceased and the related afterlife. And like many contemporary Egyptian gods,&nbsp;<em>Anubis</em>did have other aspects, but his core attributes were seemingly always related to the matters of death. For example, even during the 1st Dynasty period (circa 3100 BC),&nbsp;<em>Anubis</em>&nbsp;was perceived as a protector of graves &ndash; possibly to endow a positive aspect to the propensity of jackals who tended to dig up shallow graves.</p>\r\n<p>To that end,&nbsp;<em>Anubis</em>&nbsp;pertained to one of the rare ancient Egyptian gods, who in spite of his ancient legacy, was not venerated in dedicated precincts and temples (at least according to archaeological evidence or lack thereof). On the contrary, the tombs and mastabas of the dead were seen as his &lsquo;places of worship&rsquo;, including a particular shrine&nbsp;at Anubeion which contained the mummified remains of dogs and jackals. Suffice it to say, A<em>nubis</em>&nbsp;was often intrinsically related to the rites associated with death, and thus he&nbsp;played the role of the deity who ushered souls into the afterlife. Over time, he might have even overtaken&nbsp;<em>Osiris</em>&nbsp;as the main &lsquo;judge&rsquo; in the&nbsp;Weighing of the Heart ceremony &ndash; as depicted in the scenes from the&nbsp;<em>Book of the Dead.</em></p>\r\n<p>Now in spite of his visually striking features and frequent ancient artistic depictions &ndash; that as we mentioned before, consisted of a black jackal&rsquo;s head,&nbsp;<em>Anubis</em>&nbsp;played almost no part in the actual Egyptian mythology. And while the color black itself symbolized both&nbsp;desolation and rebirth,&nbsp;<em>Anubis</em>was possibly also associated with the god&nbsp;<em>Upuaut</em>&nbsp;(or Wepwawet), another deity with canine (or dog) features but with grey fur.</p>\r\n<h4>12) Thoth &ndash; The Ibis God</h4>\r\n<div><img style=\"line-height: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_12-min.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_12-min.jpg 600w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_12-min-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_12-min-300x300.jpg 300w\" alt=\"egyptian gods_Ancient Egyptian gods_gods_Egyptian goddess-4\" width=\"600\" height=\"598\" data-lazy-type=\"image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_12-min.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_12-min.jpg 600w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_12-min-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_12-min-300x300.jpg 300w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" />\r\n<p>Credit: Vladimiraz / Dreamstime.com</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Another one of the ancient Egyptian gods who was worshipped from the Predynastic period to the Greco-Roman times,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.crystalinks.com/thoth.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thoth</a></em>&nbsp;was an important deity of&nbsp;writing, magic, wisdom, and the moon. He was also closely associated with the principles of balance and equilibrium, which was often symbolized by his title &lsquo;Lord of Ma&rsquo;at&rsquo; &ndash; and as such,&nbsp;<em>Thoth</em>&nbsp;was also portrayed as the husband of the goddess&nbsp;<em>Maat</em>, the deity of truth, justice, and the cosmic order.</p>\r\n<p>Quite interestingly,&nbsp;<em>Thoth</em>&nbsp;had many origin stories in the Egyptian mythology, with the older lore&nbsp;mentioning how&nbsp;<em>Thoth</em>&nbsp;was either born from the lip of&nbsp;<em>Ra</em>&nbsp;or was &lsquo;self-born&rsquo;, as an ibis, which lays the cosmic egg that holds all of the creation. Later origin myths established&nbsp;<em>Thoth</em>&nbsp;as one of the characters of the&nbsp;<em>Osiris</em>&nbsp;saga, wherein the deity was oddly born when&nbsp;<em>Set</em>&nbsp;accidentally swallowed&nbsp;<em>Horus</em>&lsquo; seed.

And interestingly enough, her veneration by the ancient Egyptians was possibly inspired by the ecological scope of the realm before the Early Dynastic Period (pre 3000 BC), when the locals observed how the female&nbsp;hippopotami staunchly defended their young offspring from harm.</p>\r\n<p>Over time,&nbsp;<em>Taweret</em>&nbsp;was also worshipped as an&nbsp;apotropaic god who had the power to ward off evil influences. To that end, it is known that Egyptian mothers carried&nbsp;amulets that were carved with the symbols or images of&nbsp;<em>Taweret</em>&nbsp;to invoke her protection. By the time of the New Kingdom, her likeness was also designed on objects related to feminity, like&nbsp;cosmetic applicators, jewelry, headrests,&nbsp;and vessels.</p>\r\n<p>With her veneration possibly stemming from the observance of hippopotamus behavior in Egypt, the physical attributes of&nbsp;<em>Taweret</em>&nbsp;also followed suit, with the Egyptian goddess often portrayed as a bipedal pregnant hippopotamus&nbsp;who carried the protective&nbsp;<em>sa</em>&nbsp;sign. However, her limbs were strikingly feline in nature, while her rear end resembled a Nile crocodile.</p>\r\n<h4>14) Aten &ndash; The &lsquo;Controversial&rsquo; God</h4>\r\n<p><img style=\"line-height: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_14-min.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_14-min.jpg 770w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_14-min-300x196.jpg 300w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_14-min-768x501.jpg 768w\" alt=\"egyptian gods_Ancient Egyptian gods_gods_Egyptian goddess-2\" width=\"770\" height=\"502\" data-lazy-type=\"image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_14-min.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_14-min.jpg 770w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_14-min-300x196.jpg 300w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_14-min-768x501.jpg 768w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></p>\r\n<p>Originally considered as an aspect of other ancient Egyptian gods, namely&nbsp;<em>Ra</em>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/aten.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Aten</em></a>&nbsp;personified the disc of the sun as visible from the earth. And like other aspects following the likeness of the main deities,&nbsp;<em>Aten</em>&nbsp;was usually worshipped as a falcon-headed god, thus mirroring the image of&nbsp;<em>Ra</em>. On occasions,&nbsp;<em>Aten</em>&nbsp;was also hailed as the silver disc, thus suggesting its aspect of the moon.</p>\r\n<p>However, during the reign of&nbsp;Pharaoh Amenhotep IV &ndash; who was later known as&nbsp;<em>Akhenaten,&nbsp;</em>the Pharaoh proclaimed that&nbsp;<em>Aten</em>&nbsp;was to venerated above the other Egyptian gods. In essence, Akhenaten declared a monotheistic (or possibly henotheistic) mode of religious affiliation across all of Egypt, with the worship centered around&nbsp;<em>Aten</em>. Such a radical promulgation had deep-reaching effects on the Egyptian society and culture.</p>\r\n<p>Pertaining to the latter,&nbsp;the royal city of Amarna boasted revolutionary architecture centered around the worship of&nbsp;<em>Aten</em>. For example, most of the temples were constructed without any roofing, thus symbolically allowing the unobstructed passage of the effulgent rays of the solar deity on the worshipers inside. But such measures ultimately resulted in counter-implementations of the traditional pantheon system &ndash; with the legacy of&nbsp;Akhenaten and<em>&nbsp;Aten</em>&nbsp;being intentionally wiped out by his successors after the defiant pharaoh&rsquo;s death. Even the city of Amarna was razed by the later &lsquo;traditionalists&rsquo;, though some structural segments did survive to provide a historical glimpse into the royal city (watch the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/2016/04/16/animation-amarna-royal-egyptian-city-akhenaten/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reconstruction here</a>).</p>\r\n<h4>15) Honorable Mention &ndash; Khepri, The Beetle God</h4>\r\n<div><img style=\"line-height: inherit; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_15-min.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_15-min.jpg 600w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_15-min-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_15-min-300x300.jpg 300w\" alt=\"egyptian gods_Ancient Egyptian gods_gods_Egyptian goddess-1\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" data-lazy-type=\"image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_15-min.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_15-min.jpg 600w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_15-min-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.realmofhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts_15-min-300x300.jpg 300w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" />\r\n<p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://in.pinterest.com/pin/574842339925174153/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pinterest</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Intrinsically connected to the scarab beetle,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://egyptian-gods.org/egyptian-gods-khepri/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Khepri</em></a>&nbsp;was one of the rare Egyptian gods who was usually depicted as a man with a beetle head in Ancient Egyptian funerary papyri. There was a symbolic side to the whole affair of&nbsp;<em>Khepri</em>&nbsp;worship &ndash; with the entity epitomizing the forces that moved the sun across the vast expanse of the sky. This connection was derived from the action of scarab beetles when they rolled balls of dung across the rigorous desert surface &ndash; while the young beetles emerged from inside the dung, from the eggs laid by the parent. This is in fact related to the Egyptian word &lsquo;<em>kheper</em>&lsquo;, which roughly translates to &ndash; to change, or to create.</p>\r\n<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Khepri</em>&nbsp;was also considered as being subordinate to the more exalted sun god&nbsp;<em>Ra</em>, which on occasions also translated to&nbsp;<em>Khepri</em>&nbsp;being one of the aspects of&nbsp;<em>Ra</em>. For example,&nbsp;<em>Khepri</em>&nbsp;was perceived as the personification of the morning sun, while&nbsp;<em>Ra</em>&nbsp;was seen as the more effulgent midday sun. The people also regarded&nbsp;<em>Khepri</em>&nbsp;as one of the Egyptian gods of rebirth, possibly since the Egyptians believed beetles appeared out of nowhere and yet were able to procreate.</p>\r\n<p><em>Featured Image Credit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sporcle.com/games/kfastic/find-the-gods-and-goddesses-of-ancient-egypt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sporcle</a></em></p>\r\n<p><em>And in case we have not attributed or misattributed any image, artwork or photograph, we apologize in advance.

And printing objects with anything other than plastics<em>&mdash;</em>in particular, metal<em>&mdash;</em>has been expensive and painfully slow.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Now, however, it&rsquo;s becoming cheap and easy enough to be a potentially practical way of manufacturing parts.

It can also provide more precise control of the microstructure of metals. In 2017, researchers from the&nbsp;Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory announced they had developed a 3-D-printing method for creating stainless-steel parts twice as strong as traditionally made ones.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Also in 2017, 3-D-printing company&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/video/609714/is-3-d-printing-finally-becoming-the-manufacturing-tool-it-was-hyped-up-to-be/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Markforged</a>, a small startup based outside Boston, released the first 3-D metal printer for under $100,000.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Another Boston-area startup,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604088/the-3-d-printer-that-could-finally-change-manufacturing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Desktop Metal</a>, began to ship its first metal prototyping machines in December 2017. It plans to begin selling larger machines, designed for manufacturing, that are 100 times faster than older metal printing methods.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The printing of metal parts is also getting easier. Desktop Metal now offers software that generates designs ready for 3-D printing.

We did not realize they could self-organize so beautifully or perfectly,&rdquo; Magdelena Zernicka&shy;-Goetz, who headed the team, told an interviewer at the time.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Zernicka-Goetz says her &ldquo;synthetic&rdquo; embryos probably couldn&rsquo;t have grown into mice. Nonetheless, they&rsquo;re a hint that soon we could&nbsp;have mammals born without an egg at all.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">That isn&rsquo;t Zernicka-Goetz&rsquo;s goal. She wants to study how the cells of an early embryo begin taking on their specialized roles. The next step, she says, is to make an artificial embryo out of human stem cells, work that&rsquo;s being pursued at the University of Michigan and Rockefeller University.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Synthetic human embryos would be a boon to scientists, letting them tease apart events early in development. And since such embryos start with easily manipulated stem cells, labs will be able to employ a full range of tools, such as gene editing, to investigate them as they grow.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Artificial embryos, however, pose ethical questions. What if they turn out to be indistinguishable from real embryos? How long can they be grown in the lab before they feel pain?

Sidewalk Labs says it will open access to the software and systems it&rsquo;s creating so other companies can build services on top of them, much as people build apps for mobile phones.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The company intends to closely monitor public infrastructure, and this has raised concerns about data governance and privacy. But Sidewalk Labs believes it can work with the community and the local government to alleviate those worries.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s distinctive about what we&rsquo;re trying to do in Quayside is that the project is not only extraordinarily ambitious but also has a certain amount of humility,&rdquo; says Rit Aggarwala, the executive in charge of Sidewalk Labs&rsquo; urban-systems planning. That humility may help Quayside avoid the pitfalls that have plagued previous smart-city initiatives.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Other North American cities are already clamoring to be next on Sidewalk Labs&rsquo; list, according to Waterfront Toronto, the public agency overseeing Quayside&rsquo;s development. &ldquo;San Francisco, Denver, Los Angeles, and Boston have all called asking for introductions,&rdquo;

For many other companies and parts of the economy, AI systems are too expensive and too difficult to implement fully.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" data-widget-type=\"list\" data-widget-layout=\"\">\r\n<h5>AI for Everybody</h5>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\r\n<li>BreakthroughCloud-based AI is making the technology cheaper and easier to use.</li>\r\n<li>Why It MattersRight now the use of AI is dominated by a relatively few companies, but as a cloud-based service, it could be widely available to many more, giving the economy a boost.</li>\r\n<li>Key PlayersAmazon; Google; Microsoft</li>\r\n<li>AvailabilityNow</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">What&rsquo;s the solution? Machine-learning tools based in the cloud are bringing AI to a far broader audience. So far, Amazon dominates cloud AI with its AWS subsidiary. Google is challenging that with TensorFlow, an open-source AI library that can be used to build other machine-learning software. Recently Google announced Cloud AutoML, a suite of pre-trained systems that could make AI simpler to use.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Microsoft, which has its own AI-powered cloud platform, Azure, is teaming up with Amazon to offer Gluon, an open-source deep-learning library. Gluon is supposed to make building neural nets<em>&mdash;</em>a key technology in AI that crudely mimics how the human brain learns<em>&mdash;</em>as easy as building a smartphone app.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">It is uncertain which of these companies will become the leader in offering AI cloud services.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is a huge business opportunity for the winners.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">These products will be essential if the AI revolution is going to spread more broadly through different parts of the economy.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Currently AI is used mostly in the tech industry, where it has created efficiencies and produced new products and services. But many other businesses and industries have struggled to take advantage of the advances in artificial intelligence. Sectors such as medicine, manufacturing, and energy could also be transformed if they were able to implement the technology more fully, with a huge boost to economic productivity.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Most companies, though, still don&rsquo;t have enough people who know how to use cloud AI. So Amazon and Google are also setting up consultancy services. Once the cloud puts the technology within the reach of almost everyone, the real AI revolution can begin.&nbsp;<br />&mdash;<em>Jackie Snow</em></p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Dueling Neural Networks</h2>\r\n<figure style=\"text-align: center;\" data-widget-type=\"imageset\" data-widget-layout=\"text-col\"><picture data-iesrc=\"https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/ma18-tr10list4.png?sw=600&amp;cx=0&amp;cy=0&amp;cw=1509&amp;ch=1114\"><source srcset=\"https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/ma18-tr10list4.png?sw=600&amp;cx=0&amp;cy=0&amp;cw=1509&amp;ch=1114 1x,https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/ma18-tr10list4.png?sw=1200&amp;cx=0&amp;cy=0&amp;cw=1509&amp;ch=1114 2x\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" /><source srcset=\"https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/ma18-tr10list4.png?sw=1024&amp;cx=0&amp;cy=0&amp;cw=1509&amp;ch=1114 1x,https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/ma18-tr10list4.png?sw=2048&amp;cx=0&amp;cy=0&amp;cw=1509&amp;ch=1114 2x\" media=\"(min-width: 850px)\" /><source srcset=\"https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/ma18-tr10list4.png?sw=850&amp;cx=0&amp;cy=0&amp;cw=1509&amp;ch=1114 1x,https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/ma18-tr10list4.png?sw=1700&amp;cx=0&amp;cy=0&amp;cw=1509&amp;ch=1114 2x\" media=\"(min-width: 550px)\" /><source srcset=\"https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/ma18-tr10list4.png?sw=550&amp;cx=0&amp;cy=0&amp;cw=1509&amp;ch=1114 1x,https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/ma18-tr10list4.png?sw=1100&amp;cx=0&amp;cy=0&amp;cw=1509&amp;ch=1114 2x\" media=\"(min-width: 401px)\" /><source srcset=\"https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/ma18-tr10list4.png?sw=401&amp;cx=0&amp;cy=0&amp;cw=1509&amp;ch=1114 1x,https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/ma18-tr10list4.png?sw=802&amp;cx=0&amp;cy=0&amp;cw=1509&amp;ch=1114 2x\" media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" /><img style=\"outline-width: 0px; line-height: 0; width: 600px; max-width: 100%;\" src=\"https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/ma18-tr10list4.png?sw=600&amp;cx=0&amp;cy=0&amp;cw=1509&amp;ch=1114\" srcset=\"https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/ma18-tr10list4.png?sw=600&amp;cx=0&amp;cy=0&amp;cw=1509&amp;ch=1114 1x,https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/ma18-tr10list4.png?sw=1200&amp;cx=0&amp;cy=0&amp;cw=1509&amp;ch=1114 2x\" /></picture>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<figcaption>ILLUSTRATION BY DEREK BRAHNEY | DIAGRAM COURTESY OF&nbsp;<a href=\"http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html\">MICHAEL NIELSEN, &ldquo;NEURAL NETWORKS AND DEEP LEARNING&rdquo;, DETERMINATION PRESS, 2015</a></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Artificial intelligence is getting very good at identifying things: show it a million pictures, and it can tell you with uncanny accuracy which ones depict a pedestrian crossing a street. But AI is hopeless at generating images of pedestrians by itself. If it could do that, it would be able to create gobs of realistic but synthetic pictures depicting pedestrians in various settings, which a self-driving car could use to train itself without ever going out on the road.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" data-widget-type=\"list\" data-widget-layout=\"\">\r\n<h5>Dueling Neural Networks</h5>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\r\n<li>BreakthroughTwo AI systems can spar with each other to create ultra-realistic original images or sounds, something machines have never been able to do before.</li>\r\n<li>Why It MattersThis gives machines something akin to a sense of imagination, which may help them become less reliant on humans&mdash;but also turns them into alarmingly powerful tools for digital fakery.</li>\r\n<li>Key PlayersGoogle Brain, DeepMind, Nvidia</li>\r\n<li>AvailabilityNow</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The problem is, creating something entirely new requires imagination<em>&mdash;</em>and until now that has perplexed AIs.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The solution first occurred to Ian Goodfellow, then a PhD student at the University of Montreal, during an academic argument in a bar in 2014. The approach, known as a generative adversarial network, or GAN, takes two neural networks<em>&mdash;</em>the simplified mathematical models of the human brain that underpin most modern machine learning<em>&mdash;</em>and pits them against each other in a digital cat-and-mouse game.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Both networks are trained on the same data set. One, known as the generator, is tasked with creating variations on images it&rsquo;s already seen<em>&mdash;</em>perhaps a picture of a pedestrian with an extra arm. The second, known as the discriminator, is asked to identify whether the example it sees is like the images it has been trained on or a fake produced by the generator<em>&mdash;</em>basically, is that three-armed person likely to be real?</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Over time, the generator can become so good at producing images that the discriminator can&rsquo;t spot fakes. Essentially, the generator has been taught to recognize, and then create, realistic-looking images of pedestrians.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The technology has become one of the most promising advances in AI in the past decade, able to help machines produce results that fool even humans.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">GANs have been put to use creating realistic-sounding speech and photorealistic fake imagery. In one compelling example, researchers from chipmaker Nvidia primed a GAN with celebrity photographs to create hundreds of credible faces of people who don&rsquo;t exist. Another research group made not-unconvincing fake paintings that look like the works of van Gogh. Pushed further, GANs can reimagine images in different ways<em>&mdash;</em>making a sunny road appear snowy, or turning horses into zebras.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The results aren&rsquo;t always perfect: GANs can conjure up bicycles with two sets of handlebars, say, or faces with eyebrows in the wrong place. But because the images and sounds are often startlingly realistic, some experts believe there&rsquo;s a sense in which GANs are beginning to understand the underlying structure of the world they see and hear. And that means AI may gain, along with a sense of imagination, a more independent ability to make sense of what it sees in the world.&nbsp;&mdash;<em>Jamie Condliffe</em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>', 'technology', 'img/posts/post5baf76502ee8d.jpg', 1, 'published', '2018-09-29 12:53:17.636759');

Everyone Has a Story in Life</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">A 24 year old boy seeing out from the train&rsquo;s window shouted&hellip;</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">&ldquo;Dad, look the trees are going behind!&rdquo;</div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Dad smiled and a young couple sitting nearby, looked at the 24 year old&rsquo;s childish behavior with pity, suddenly he again exclaimed&hellip;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&ldquo;Dad, look the clouds are running with us!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The couple couldn&rsquo;t resist and said to the old man&hellip;</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><center>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</center></div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take your son to a good doctor?&rdquo; The old man smiled and said&hellip;&ldquo;I did and we are just coming from the hospital, my son was blind from birth, he just got his eyes today.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Every single person on the planet has a story. Don&rsquo;t judge people before you truly know them. The truth might surprise you.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>2. Shake off Your Problems</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">A man&rsquo;s favorite donkey falls into a deep precipice. He can&rsquo;t pull it out no matter how hard he tries. He therefore decides to bury it alive.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Soil is poured onto the donkey from above. The donkey feels the load, shakes it off, and steps on it. More soil is poured.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">It shakes it off and steps up. The more the load was poured, the higher it rose. By noon, the donkey was grazing in green pastures.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">After much shaking off (of problems) And stepping up (learning from them), One will graze in GREEN PASTURES.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.livin3.com/positive-quotes\">127 Positive Quotes to Help You Live Your Best Life</a></strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>3. The Elephant Rope</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.livin3.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/elephant-and-rope.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4691\"><img style=\"height: auto; max-width: 50%; line-height: 0;\" src=\"https://www.livin3.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/elephant-and-rope.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" srcset=\"https://www.livin3.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/elephant-and-rope.jpg 480w, https://www.livin3.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/elephant-and-rope-300x221.jpg 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"354\" /></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">As a man was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped, confused by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. No chains, no cages. It was obvious that the elephants could, at anytime, break away from their bonds but for some reason, they did not.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; trainer said, &ldquo;when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it&rsquo;s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The man was amazed. These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they couldn&rsquo;t, they were stuck right where they were.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Like the elephants, how many of us go through life hanging onto a belief that we cannot do something, simply because we failed at it once before?</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Failure is part of learning; we should never give up the struggle in life.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>4. Potatoes, Eggs, and Coffee Beans</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Once upon a time a daughter complained to her father that her life was miserable and that she didn&rsquo;t know how she was going to make it. She was tired of fighting and struggling all the time. It seemed just as one problem was solved, another one soon followed.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><center>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</center></div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Her father, a chef, took her to the kitchen. He filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. Once the three pots began to boil, he placed potatoes in one pot, eggs in the second pot, and ground coffee beans in the third pot.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">He then let them sit and boil, without saying a word to his daughter. The daughter, moaned and impatiently waited, wondering what he was doing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">After twenty minutes he turned off the burners. He took the potatoes out of the pot and placed them in a bowl. He pulled the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.livin3.com/boiled-egg-diet\">boiled eggs</a>&nbsp;out and placed them in a bowl.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">He then ladled the coffee out and placed it in a cup. Turning to her he asked. &ldquo;Daughter, what do you see?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&ldquo;Potatoes, eggs, and coffee,&rdquo; she hastily replied.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&ldquo;Look closer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and touch the potatoes.&rdquo; She did and noted that they were soft. He then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, he asked her to sip the coffee. Its rich aroma brought a smile to her face.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&ldquo;Father, what does this mean?&rdquo; she asked.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">He then explained that the potatoes, the eggs and coffee beans had each faced the same adversity&ndash; the boiling water.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">However, each one reacted differently.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The potato went in strong, hard, and unrelenting, but in boiling water, it became soft and weak.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The egg was fragile, with the thin outer shell protecting its liquid interior until it was put in the boiling water. Then the inside of the egg became hard.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">However, the ground coffee beans were unique. After they were exposed to the boiling water, they changed the water and created something new.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&ldquo;Which are you,&rdquo; he asked his daughter. &ldquo;When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a potato, an egg, or a coffee bean? &ldquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"Moral:In\">Moral:In</a> life, things happen around us, things happen to us, but the only thing that truly matters is what happens within us.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Which one are you?</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><center>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</center></div>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>5.

A waitress put a glass of water in front of him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&ldquo;How much is an ice cream sundae?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&ldquo;50 cents,&rdquo; replied the waitress.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied a number of coins in it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&ldquo;How much is a dish of plain ice cream?&rdquo; he inquired. Some people were now waiting for a table and the waitress was a bit impatient.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&ldquo;35 cents,&rdquo; she said brusquely.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The little boy again counted the coins. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the plain ice cream,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and departed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">When the waitress came back, she began wiping down the table and then swallowed hard at what she saw.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were 15 cents &ndash; her tip.</p>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Motivational Stories for Business and Work</strong></h1>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Succeeding in business is no easy feat.

Colonel Sanders | Kentucky Fried Chicken</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.livin3.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/KFC-owner.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4688\"><img style=\"height: auto; max-width: 100%; line-height: 0;\" src=\"https://www.livin3.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/KFC-owner.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"699\" height=\"507\" /></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Once, there was an older man, who was broke, living in a tiny house and owned a beat up car. He was living off of $99 social security checks. At 65 years of age, he decide things had to change. So he thought about what he had to offer. His friends raved about his chicken recipe. He decided that this was his best shot at making a change.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">He left Kentucky and traveled to different states to try to sell his recipe. He told restaurant owners that he had a mouthwatering chicken recipe. He offered the recipe to them for free, just asking for a small percentage on the items sold. Sounds like a good deal, right?</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Unfortunately, not to most of the restaurants. He heard NO over 1000 times. Even after all of those rejections, he didn&rsquo;t give up. He believed his chicken recipe was something special. He got rejected 1009 times before he heard his first yes.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">With that one success Colonel Hartland Sanders changed the way Americans eat chicken. Kentucky Fried Chicken, popularly known as KFC, was born.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><center>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</center></div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Remember, never give up and always believe in yourself in spite of rejection.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>2. The Obstacle in our Path</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">There once was a very wealthy and curious king. This king had a huge boulder placed in the middle of a road. Then he hid nearby to see if anyone would try to remove the gigantic rock from the road.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The first people to pass by were some of the king&rsquo;s wealthiest merchants and courtiers. Rather than moving it, they simply walked around it. A few loudly blamed the King for not maintaining the roads. Not one of them tried to move the boulder.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Finally, a peasant came along. His arms were full of vegetables. When he got near the boulder, rather than simply walking around it as the others had, the peasant put down his load and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. It took a lot of effort but he finally succeeded.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The peasant gathered up his load and was ready to go on his way when he say a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The peasant opened the purse. The purse was stuffed full of gold coins and a note from the king. The king&rsquo;s note said the purse&rsquo;s gold was a reward for moving the boulder from the road.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The king showed the peasant what many of us never understand: every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>3.

No matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it because it did not decrease in value. It was still worth $20. Many times in our lives, life crumples us and grinds us into the dirt. We make bad decisions or deal with poor circumstances. We feel worthless. But no matter what has happened or what will happen, you will never lose your value. You are special &ndash; Don&rsquo;t ever forget it!</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>4. A Very Special Bank Account</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Imagine you had a bank account that deposited $86,400 each morning. The account carries over no balance from day to day, allows you to keep no cash balance, and every evening cancels whatever part of the amount you had failed to use during the day. What would you do? Draw out every dollar each day!</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">We all have such a bank. Its name is Time. Every morning, it credits you with 86,400 seconds. Every night it writes off, as lost, whatever time you have failed to use wisely. It carries over no balance from day to day. It allows no overdraft so you can&rsquo;t borrow against yourself or use more time than you have. Each day, the account starts fresh. Each night, it destroys an unused time. If you fail to use the day&rsquo;s deposits, it&rsquo;s your loss and you can&rsquo;t appeal to get it back.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">There is never any borrowing time. You can&rsquo;t take a loan out on your time or against someone else&rsquo;s. The time you have is the time you have and that is that. Time management is yours to decide how you spend the time, just as with money you decide how you spend the money. It is never the case of us not having enough time to do things, but the case of whether we want to do them and where they fall in our priorities.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Motivational Weight Loss Stories</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Losing weight feels like a constant uphill battle.
